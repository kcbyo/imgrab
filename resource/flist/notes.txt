The good news: we can figure out image urls on the basis of one API call, and the API spits out JSON.

The bad news: to make the API call, we need the character id.

More good news: the character's id is on the profile page and may be found with the following regex:

<input type='hidden' id='profile-character-id' value='(\d+)'/>

More bad news: I think the profile page is behind an age confirmation block thing.

More good news: The age block thing has an... Interesting implementation. The way it works is that you receive a "warning" cookie on your first visit to the site. Any access to the site which includes that cookie will not receive such a warning. Actually clicking the "proceed" link itself does nothing other than attempt to access your original destination a second time---which succeeds because, as I pointed out, the warning cookie is already in place by that point.
